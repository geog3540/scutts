		 <p class="card-text">I used family tree data to create my flow map, depicting family migration between U.S. states from 1887 to 1924. For my basemap, I selected “ESRI Dark Gray Canvas”—a choice I knew would contrast nicely with my choropleth polygons. Since net migration is a bipolar variable, I decided to represent it using the choropleth map, since I thought that polygons would be a better choice for a divergent color scheme than nodes or flows. When Koylu & Guo (2017) compared the usefulness of five different line symbolizations in a user study, they found that an arrowhead with a divergent color scheme failed at many tasks, likely because it overly divided participants’ attention among multiple attributes. Additionally, when Koylu, Tian, & Windsor (2023) mapped this same dataset on a flow map, they decided to represent a bipolar variable (migration efficiency) on their choropleth map with a divergent color scheme. I decided to follow their example, using FlowMapper’s “Red-Blue” color scheme for my six classes. Since red is commonly used to represent negative values in bipolar datasets, and blue positive ones, this choice seemed appropriate.</p>
		 <p class="card-text">Continuing to follow the example of Koylu et al. (2023), I decided to use my map’s nodes to represent gross migration. However, I selected four classes instead of three (to better show this variable’s range of values) and used a green color scheme instead of a gray one. While the gray scheme would have too closely matched my basemap, the green one contrasted nicely with my choropleth polygons. I used the same color scheme for my flows, which represent the total number of families immigrating from one state to another. I also selected “Curve Half Arrow” as my flow style, since that choice seemed to do the best job at simultaneously limiting clutter and indicating the direction of migration. I decided to only depict the top 100 flows for that same reason.</p>
		 <p class="card-text">On my map, Oklahoma stands out as the state with the darkest blue shading. The only state in the highest net migration class, it clearly experienced the greatest influx of migrants during this period. Oklahoma also has one of the largest green nodes, which means that it experienced high gross migration. Though many families both arrived and left the state, arrivals far outpaced departures. This dramatic population gain can be linked to the 1897 discovery of oil in Oklahoma, which sparked a major economic boom. The oil industry drew waves of settlers, workers, and speculators, making Oklahoma a powerful magnet for migration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
		 <p class="card-text">Other notable destinations include California, Idaho, and Washington, which also attracted substantial numbers of families during this time period, though to a lesser degree than Oklahoma. In contrast, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri were major sources of outbound migration. These states are shaded in red, indicating net losses of families. Though their large node sizes suggest high gross migration, because these states are net exporters, we can infer that the vast majority of that movement involved families leaving the area.</p>
		 <p class="card-text">The dominant direction of flows is westward and southwestward. During this period, families in the South and Midwest were leaving in large numbers and heading into emerging states like Oklahoma and California. This westward movement reflects broader historical patterns of economic expansion, frontier settlement, and the lure of opportunity in newer regions—especially those transformed by natural resource discoveries like Oklahoma’s oil fields. While some movement occurred between adjacent regions (such as from the Southeast into the lower Midwest), these flows typically weren't large enough to offset the overarching trend of net emigration from those areas.</p>
		 <p class="card-text">When we look at the relationship between migration patterns and the map’s symbology, a clear narrative takes shape. Large green nodes paired with blue shading, as seen in Oklahoma and Texas, signal states with high gross migration and net population gains. Meanwhile, large nodes combined with red or orange shading, like those in Kentucky, Arkansas, and Missouri, reflect states that experienced heavy outbound movement and shrinking populations. Smaller circles and pale shading in states like those in New England or the Great Plains reflect relatively low migration activity.</p>
		 <p class="card-text">Ultimately, this map reveals a national story of movement and opportunity shaped by geography and history. From 1887 to 1924, both the South and Midwest were regions many families left behind. The strongest pull was toward the Southwest—particularly Oklahoma, whose oil boom and rapid development made it the defining destination of this era of American migration.</p>
